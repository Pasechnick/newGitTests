> git add -A 
> git add -all 

adds all changes to commit 

> git reset                 // unchanges all changes (commits)
> git add -A myDirectory/   // add changes within specific directory only

> git add                   // makes "git add -A" command, because it is a default command
> git add myDirectory/      // the same command as "git add -A myDirectory/"

> git add -u                // adds all updated/modified files or deleted, but not the untracked ones
> git add -u myDirectory/   // does the same in the specific directory

> git ad .                  // add all files in the directory we are in right now
it is same as to write "git add -A ." (add all files in my current directory)

so "git ad ." will add only files that are in the directory we re in right now and will skip on the level up ../..

> git add -A                // will add all files in the current directory and in the whole project (entire working tree), where "git ad ." add files only in the current directory

> git add *                 // use with caution, cuz * is a SHELL command and will not see the deleted files, cuz only git knows what files are deleted but not the file system
we can get very unexpected results NOT USE
