> git config --global user.name "AlexMi" 
> git config --global user.email "mitupov@gmail.com" 
> git config --list  // will lit all the user configuration

> git config --help  // manual of git to get help

> git init // to initialize the local directory
after that command we will have ".git" file in the directory, so, after
we delete this folder (.git) we will not track that directory with git

> rm -rf .git   // removes the git folder in the tracked directory so we no longer 
track the folder with git

> git status

in order to hide some files that we want to save locally, we use git ignore command
> touch git.ignore // creates git ignore file that include files we want not to commit to git system
for example we can use "*" sign to mark all files we want to ignore *.py all python files will be ignored

> git add -A // adds all the files in the directory

> git reset calc.py  // will remove the file from commit 

> git add -A
> git commit -m "Initial commit"
> git status

> git log // shows infos about all our commits we have made


CONNECT GIT with SSH to my GitHub 2024 April

1. we need to generate SSH key pair on our computer:
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mitupov@gmail.com"  // we use email associated with GitHub

after that it will locally generate a pair here: 
/Users/alex/.ssh/id_ed25519
/Users/alex/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

2. then we need ro add the public key into the GitHub, so we just use "cat" or "pbcopy" to get the key
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
or
> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub   // will copy the key directly into the clipboard

after that we copy paste that key into GitHub "SSH and GPG" keys section
means, now i can clone, change, work with projects i have on my GitHub Repository

> git remote -v  // shows us information about the remote repo
> git diff       // will show us what changes i have made
